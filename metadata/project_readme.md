The application helps to support effective farming by monitoring crop growth using crop guide and provide timely alert to farmers about weather change, possible development of crop disease, evaporation of fungicide, and efficient use of solar panels (agrivoltaics support).

What is an accelerator?
- Industry Accelerators are a packaged set of technical assets used to help you tackle your next data science project by addressing your most pressing business challenges. With sample data, notebooks, scripts, a sample application and more, you can kickstart your own implementation and leverage the power of Cloud Pak for Data.

Key challenges
- Climate change can disrupt food availability, reduce access to food, and affect food quality. For example, projected increases in temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, changes in extreme weather events, and reductions in water availability may all result in reduced agricultural productivity.
- As summer heat intensifies, farmers and farm workers will face increasingly grueling and potentially unsafe working conditions.
- Accelerating crop failures and livestock losses will make farmers with access to insurance or disaster relief programs more reliant on those taxpayer-funded supports, while those without sufficient safety nets will face additional challenges. Failing farms and stagnating farm profits will also increase suffering in many rural communities.

The notebooks teach the user to extract, clean and analyze sample weather data and predict weather trends to help airports schedule better flight times. This sample project contains 1 notebooks and 1 CSV file. Please run the notebooks in sequential order of their part numbers using a Python 3.7 runtime.
